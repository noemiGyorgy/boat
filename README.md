# Position streamer

The position streamer app is a mockup app for a boat tracker application, which records the coordinates, direction of the boat. The position streamer accepts a csv file with coordinates and the direction of a boat and it streams the rows of the file.

Check out [the README of the frontend](https://github.com/noemiGyorgy/boat-tracker) for more information.
